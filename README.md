### Dedupe: Implemented in Java and Groovy

This project is an implementation of a simple command-line utility that identifies and selectively
deletes duplicate files.  I decided to create it to clean up a shared family photos Dropbox folder
with a few hundred files, many of which have been renamed and re-copied.

For the record, Dad, the most useful files names are dates! (Love ya!) :)

I'm implementing the tool in both Java and Groovy, treating it as an educational project for
learning the Groovy and its differences from Java (which kind of stinks on the command line).
